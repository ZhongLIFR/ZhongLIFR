## Short Bio
My name is Zhong Li, and I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Leiden University, affiliated with the [EDA Lab](https://eda.liacs.nl/). I am fortunate  to be supervised  by [Dr. Matthijs van Leeuwen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GGLwU28AAAAJ&hl=en) (daily supervisor, promotor) and [Prof. Dr. Thomas BÃ¤ck](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x7LEID0AAAAJ&hl=en) (promotor).

### Research Interests: 
I am interested in the field of Data Mining and Machine Learning. More specifically, I work on *explainable* and *generalizable* anomaly detection, with a focus on but not limited to complex data such as *event sequence* and *graph-structured data*. 

### Research Keywords: 
---**Methodologies-Oriented**: Unsupervised Machine Learning; Anomaly Detection; Transfer Learning; XAI; Graph Neural Networks
---**Applications-Oriented**: Log Analysis; Predictive Maintenance; Digital Twin; AI for Manufacturing
