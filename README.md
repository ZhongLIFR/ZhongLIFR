## 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm **Zhong Li**, a postdoctoral researcher in Computer Science at **Leiden University**, affiliated with the [EDA Lab](https://eda.liacs.nl/).  

I earned my PhD under the supervision of [Dr. Matthijs van Leeuwen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GGLwU28AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Dr. Thomas Bäck](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x7LEID0AAAAJ&hl=en) at Leiden University.  
In 2024, I also spent time as a visiting PhD researcher in the [DAML Group](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/daml/home/) at **Technical University of Munich**, where I had the pleasure of being advised by [Prof. Dr. Stephan Günnemann](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=npqoAWwAAAAJ&hl=de).
