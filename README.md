## Short Bio
My name is Zhong Li, and I am a postdoc in Computer Science at Leiden University, affiliated with the [EDA Lab](https://eda.liacs.nl/). Previously, I did my PhD 
with [Dr. Matthijs van Leeuwen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GGLwU28AAAAJ&hl=en) (daily supervisor, promotor) and [Prof. Dr. Thomas Bäck](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x7LEID0AAAAJ&hl=en) (promotor) at Leiden University. During my PhD, I  also worked as a visiting PhD researcher in [DAML](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/daml/home/) group at Technical University of Munich in 2024, where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Dr. Stephan Günnemann](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=npqoAWwAAAAJ&hl=de).

### Research Interests: 
I have a broad interest in Data Mining and Machine Learning. During my PhD, my research focused on *trustworthy anomaly detection*, with a focus on but not limited to complex data types such as *event sequences* and *graph-structured data*. More recently, my work has partially shifted towards generative models, especially Diffusion Models and Flow Matching.
