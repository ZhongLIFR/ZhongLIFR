My name is Zhong Li, and I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Leiden University, affiliated with the EDA Lab. I am fortunate  to be supervised  by Dr. Matthijs van Leeuwen (daily supervisor, promotor) and Prof. Dr. Thomas BÃ¤ck (promotor).

Research Interests: I am interested in the field of Data Mining and Machine Learning. More specifically, I work on explainable and generalizable anomaly detection, with a focus on but not limited to complex data such as event sequence and graph-structured data. 

Research Keywords: 

Methodologies-Oriented: Unsupervised Machine Learning; Anomaly Detection; Transfer Learning; XAI; Graph Neural Networks

Applications-Oriented: Log Analysis; Predictive Maintenance; Digital Twin; AI for Manufacturing
